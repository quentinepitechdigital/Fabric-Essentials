# Fabric-Essentials
Fabric Essentials, 1.20.1 porting (not finished)

## Need some kind of help
I still need to find a way to implement the new API as I'm very new to Java.

On branch old_apiport there is the original api port by creators of create
It is not the latest one because this one is the latest that works. The others have missing dependencies, or at least I couldnt find them
